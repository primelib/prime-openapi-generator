# Nitro OpenAPI Generator

## The Generator

Why the custom generator?

* typed templates with ide-plugin for code-completion
* flexible code generation (specifically, generate a template for each operation)
* a different template engine (pebble), which is easier to read/maintain

## Templates

This generator is still compatible with old templates by using the original generator, templates in this project will only work with this custom generator.

* Java8 - Feign
