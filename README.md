# *PrimeCodeGen* - A custom openapi code generator

## The Generator

Why the custom generator?

* typed templates with ide-plugin for code-completion
* flexible code generation (specifically, generate a template for each operation)
* a different template engine (pebble), which is easier to read/maintain
